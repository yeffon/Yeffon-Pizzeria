# Yeffon-Pizzeria
This is a pizzeria console app I am working on in C++

I am trying to get up on another language and I chose C++. This pizza console app is suppose to ask the user the follow:

- What food they want (Pizza, Wings, Desserts)
- Ask how many of a certain food they want
- Ask for perferred flavors or toppings
- Store all of they information before asking for a confirmation to place the full order
